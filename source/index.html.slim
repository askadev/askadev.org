    p You know the feeling. Cache-clearing refreshes, stale coffee, tufts of hair. There <em>has</em> to be a better way. Someone <em>must</em> know what I'm doing wrong.
    p Whether you're a new programmer, a veteran exploring a new language, or a tech-adverse soul lost in a sea of WYSIWYG site generators, we're here to help. Join us for a few hours every other week as we answer your frustrations:
    p Should I update my WordPress plugins? Can I use ES6 in a webpack file? How do I configure continuous deployment to S3? Does everybody still love Raymond?

  header: h2 Why?
  .content
    p While you can Google your way out of any problem, pairing with someone just <em>feels better</em>. Not all of us are fortunate enough to claim a CS degree or enjoy the guidance of a senior. <strong>We want to be the mentor we never had.</strong>
    p Or maybe you need a quick website for your photography portfolio but can't connect a custom domain to Squarespace. <strong>We want to help.</strong>

.container
  header: h3 Where can I find you?
  .content
    p Check the most recent <a href="#upcoming-events">event listings</a> for upcoming meetups. We're not partnered, sanctioned, or affiliated with our public meeting places: we're just normal customers, so please plan to patronize. Organizers will be sporting the <a href=#{image_path('logo.svg')}>Ask a Dev logo</a>.

.container
  header: h3 How long will you help?
  .content
    p As long as we can within reason. Some problems are bigger than three hours, and while we <strong>are not</strong> here to solicit, extra-curricular freelancing is permissible. However, as long as we're hosting office hours, we're free.

.container#can-i-join
  header: h3 Can I join?
  .content
    p If you've got something to teach, we've got someone to learn. Show up at the next scheduled event and tap an organizer about being listed here.
    p Out of state? <a href="mailto:askadevorg@gmail.com">Drop us an email</a>, and we'll work on starting a chapter in your neighborhood.
